The Cray-2 was designed on a module basis.  

A module is described by a three primary files.

Names are composed of the two character module code followed by one three digit code that 
represents the file type (BOL/PKG or CON). 


- BOOLEAN SOURCE FILE (bol)
	The boolean file is a set of boolean equations that logically describe the module.
	
- PACKAGE FILE (pkg)
	The second file is the package file. The package file has the format of a line for 
	each chip location in the module. Modules were made of a stack of eight boards. The
	first two characters of each line of the package file describe the location of a chip.
	Chips on the top board had a location that begins with A,B or C. The next board D,E, or F, 
	the next board G,H,or I on down to the last board that has locations beginning with
	V,W or X. Each board has locations for 96 chips (32 beginning with each of
	3 characters). The second characters of the location was one of A-X,1-8 to
	specify one of the 32 possible locations. Three sets of 32 locations gives
	96 locations of each board. The location is followed by a dash and the
	dash is followed by a list of the outputs (boolean terms in the boolean file)
	that are outputs at that location.

- CONNECTOR FILE (con)
	The third file is the connector file.  It describes the three 12 pin (24 differential pair) 
	connectors on each board of the module. ZA,ZB and ZC are on the top board.  ZD,ZE and ZF 
	are on the next board etc. Each of the three connectors on each board has 12 pins (24 differential pairs)
	of output or input signals.

An application, pkgmap, is then used to create the 'pkgout' file from the pkg file. This is an intermediary step before
generating the verilog code with the parspin program which utilizes the 'pkgout' file, boolean source file, and connector file.
