# Cray-2-Reboot
Welcome to the Readme file for the Cray-2 Reboot project!

The goal of this project is to make a clock and gate equivalent recreation of a Cray Research Cray-2 supercomputer that will run on an FPGA board. Resources permitting, a small IC run using MOSIS or CMP will be the stretch goal for the project.

This project will be made of a number of phases:

1) Conversion of module logic to working Verilog code

2) Cleanup of Verilog code

3) Interconnecting all the Verilog together into a functional machine 

4) Software emulation of the Verilog code for verification 

5) Recovery and/or creation of basic OS & C compiler for the system (c complier will likely be a translated version of TCC) 

6) Testing on FPGAs
