CRAY-2
Vector Register, Parallel,
Shared-Memory Architecture

Architecture. This is a four-processor (quadrant) vector machine with
pipelining and overlapping but no chaining. There are more segments in the
pipes than in the other CRAYs. Multitasking primitives have same syntax as the
X-MP. The system has a 4.1-ns clock cycle time. Memory is 256 Mwords of
256K DRAM in 128 banks. The bank busy time is 57 clocks. and the scalar
memory access time is 59 clocks. Local memory is 16 Kwords, 4 clocks from
local memory to vector registers. Vector references from local memory must be
with unit stride. There are 8 vector registers each with 64 elements.

Overheads for vector operations are large:
63 cycles for vector load
22 cycles for vector multiply
22 cycles for vector add
63 cycles for vector store

Recent enhancements to the CRAY-2 include a 512-Mword memory and models
with 128-Mword static RAM. Other improvements include implementing functional units
in VLSI (and cutting latency time by half ), a large instruction buffer,
reduced branch time, and faster issue rates for certain sequences of instructions.

Configurations. Cray has an ongoing commitment to high-speed peripherals 
and fast network links. HSX is a 100Mbytes/s link for connecting CRAYs
together. CRAYs can be linked to Ultra Corporations 1.6-Gbit Ultra bus in
addition to standard connections with Ethernet (TCP/IP), and VME buses. The
DD-40 disks each hold 5 Gbytes and have a transfer rate of 10Mbytes/s. The
machine is liquid-cooled using inert fluorocarbon.
