# Cray-2-Reboot
This is a reconstruction of a Cray Research Cray-2 supercomputer in Verilog.  

The goal of this project is to make a gate equivalent recreation that will run on an FPGA board. Resources permitting, a small IC run using MOSIS or CMP will be would be the stretch goal for the project.

This project will be made of a a number of phases:
1) Conversion of module logic to working verilog code
2) Interconnecting all the verilog together into a funtional machine
3) Software emulation of the verilog code for verification
4) Recovery and/or creation of basic OS & C compiler for the system
5) Testing on FPGAs
