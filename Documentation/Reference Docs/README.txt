The Cray-2 was the next generation after the Cray-1 and shares a lot of similar features.  

The Cray-3 was the successor, and could run all Cray-2 programs unmodified, only a few additional instructions
were added to the Cray-3. If you look through the functional guide you'll notice the Cray-3 background
processors were essentially identical to the Cray-2 background processors.
